My current thoughts about utilizing the R programming language for data science 
are very positive. I find that the open sourceability and functionality of R 
allow for the applications of it to be limitless at times and check all of the 
boxes for the needs of a data scientist. However, when researching into job 
prospects, it appears that the desire to program in python is higher than R, 
which makes me want to consider looking into others languages to help with 
future marketability. That being said, I certainly will never stop using R for 
the rest of my professional career because I find it to be far too powerful to 
not take advantage of it. The ability to run models and make fascinating 
visualizations will always be great tools in my toolbox as I progress in any 
future job and I look forward to impressing my peers and superiors with the 
skills I have gained in this course.  
  
There are certainly a few things I plan to do differently in practice now that 
I have taken this course. For one, I will explore the uses of all of the 
statistical learning models we learned, and more, as I previously only knew how 
to use linear models. I also plan on utilizing more visualizations to not only 
allow myself to better understand relationships and patterns, but also for my 
peers so that I can better communicate findings. Finally, I hope to use github 
far more as a place for storing, displaying, and collaborating on all future 
projects.  
  
I recently signed a job offer for a biostatistician position so I am very 
excited to further explore that field and apply what I have learned in this 
class to my new job. My future manager has expressed the companyâ€™s interest in 
having employees complete exploratory/data science side projects in R so I do 
not think I could have picked a better course to prepare me for those tasks and 
I think deeper knowledge of R will be critical as it seems like the 
pharmaceutical and regulatory industries may be shifting away from SAS over the 
next several years. Regardless of what happens, I know that I will be prepared 
and could easily adapt to industry shifts thanks to my efforts in this class and 
in the statistics masters program as a whole.
