Hello! I am a current graduate student at NCSU, where I am finishing up my master's in statistics. This blog is an assignment for my ST 558 class and is where I will showcase what I have learned in data science!

```{r dplyr image, out.width = "70px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/simonweisenhorn/Desktop/Master/School/Classes/ST 558/Homework/ST 558/dplyr.png")
```

### Here are a few things that I like to do:
